Thanks for trying out Piano Trainer.  The objective of this program/game is to train your fingers to learn what keys on a piano correspond to what notes.  The game will show you a letter and number such as F5, which means you need to hit the corresponding key on your piano (in this case it would be the fifth octave for F).  

What you'll need:

- python (recommend python 32 bit 3.8.2)
- install pygame (hint: run "py -m pip install -U pygame --user" on a cmd prompt, without quotes)
- connect a MIDI piano before starting the program

Usage: simply run Piano.py and do what it says



v 0.1 (5/7/2020)
	- created the initial idea for the game
	- used public code from https://audiodestrukt.wordpress.com/2013/06/23/midi-programming-in-python/ to set up the initial reading from the midi device
	- game can successfully detect inputs correctly from keys A1 to G4#
	- game can successfully ask you to hit a random note from A1 to G4# via console
	- game shows a message when you succeed in hitting a correct note and a message when you hit the wrong note
	TODO:
	- create a gui/window based output
	- create a system that shows a sheet music note equivalent
	- accept/request multiple keys at the same time
	- show a cascading system that shows what notes are coming up next (for playing real music)
	- create a system that allows you to import music via text files
	- regarding the previous requirement: create another program that lets you CREATE the music files from the midi keyboard


v 0.2 (5/7/2020)
	- added a window system
	- all keys are now available
	- more comments added to code
	TO DO:
	- create a system that shows a sheet music note equivalent
	- accept/request multiple keys at the same time
	- show a cascading system that shows what notes are coming up next (for playing real music)
	- create a system that allows you to import music via text files
	- regarding the previous requirement: create another program that lets you CREATE the music files from the midi keyboard


v 0.3 (5/7/2020)
	- now shows a picture of a note
	Immediate TODO for next commit:
		- create all 88 sheet music notes
